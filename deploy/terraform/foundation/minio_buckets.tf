# The datalake bucket is created by the minio-init container in docker-compose.yml
# on first deploy.  This Terraform resource tracks the bucket's existence and
# prevents accidental destruction.
#
# Requires: terraform/services docker_compose_deploy applied first (MinIO CE running on VM).
# If migrating from AIStor: run `terraform state rm minio_s3_bucket.datalake` once
# to clear the old state entry before re-applying.
